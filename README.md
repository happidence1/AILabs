# AI Tech Labs (Credit to Dr. Jian Tao at TAMU HPRC)
A set of Jupyter Notebooks to get a new user started with his/her machine learning projects on [Texas A&M High Performance Research Computing](https://hprc.tamu.edu/) systems. There are totally four labs.

### Lab 1. Jupyter Notebook (15 mins)
We will set up a Python virtual environment and run JupyterLab on the HPRC Portal.

### Lab 2. Data Exploration (30 mins)
We will go through  simple examples with two popular Python modules: Pandas and Matplotlib for simple data exploration. 

### Lab 3. Machine Learning (30 minutes)
We will learn to use scikit-learn for linear regression and classification applications.

### Lab 4. Deep Learning (30 minutes)
We will learn how to use Keras to create and train a  simple image classification model with deep neural network (DNN).
